# Options Data

This is a repo of Python 3 programs that use requests and beautiful soup to navigate to the NASDAQ website and scrape option data into CSVs.

I've only actually written the script to get Call data. So even though it says "option data" it's actually only Call Data right now. I will eventually write the Put portion of the script.
